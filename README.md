# Parallaxite

A portfolio website with CSS only grid and a large parallax header.

Inspired by http://www.firewatchgame.com/ which is absolutely stunning.
CSS grid derived from http://www.dwuser.com/education/content/creating-responsive-tiled-layout-with-pure-css/

Everything is on a single html file which makes this kind of bloated. If anyone wants to use some MV* framework like backbone to load only the stuff that's necessary, that would be great. I might work on that later.

There is an issue on iOS where chrome's hiding navbar messes up the dimentions and it doesn't reset properly. I've tries javascript timers to manually force resizing without success...
